  <h1>Yo, I'm Josh. I'm an artist.</h1>
  <p>It's nice to meet you, too.</p>


  <h2>Cool. What kind of art do you make?</h2>
  <p>
    My art is kind of like ASMR for your eyes.
  </p>
  <p>
    I grew up and live in New England and take inspiration from
    the world around me. (Who doesn't?) I really dig rocks and clouds
    and root vegetables and moving bodies. My art incorporates natural shapes
    and textures and colors and movement.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hope you feel curious and calm when you look at my art. If do, please let me know. And if you don't, <emph>please</emph> let me know what you do feel!
  </p>

  <h2>So, what's your story?</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a guy living in a mountain valley in northern New England. When I was younger I studied math at Harvard, then computer science at UMass Boston, and then systems biology at Harvard again.
    </p>
    <p>
      These days my non-artist time is spent building software that forecasts the weather. I like spontaneous dance parties, and my favorite color is orange. All of these things make it into my art one way or another.
