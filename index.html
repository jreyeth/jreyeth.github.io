    <h1>Yo, I'm Josh. I'm an artist.</h1>

  <h2>Cool. What kind of art do you make?</h2>
  <p>
    My art is ASMR for your eyes.
  </p>
  <p>
    I grew up and live in New England and take inspiration from
    the world around me. (Who doesn't?) I really dig rocks and clouds
    and root vegetables and moving bodies. My art incorporates natural shapes
    and textures and colors and movement.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hope you feel curious and calmed when you look at my art. If do, please let me know. And if you don't, <emph>please</emph> let me know what you do feel!
  </p>

  <h2>So, what's your story?</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a guy living in a mountain valley in northern New England. These days my non-artist time is spent building software that forecasts the weather and making maps. I like spontaneous dance parties. My favorite color is orange.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was younger I studied math at Harvard, then computer science at UMass Boston, and then systems biology at Harvard again. All of these things make it into my art one way or another.
    </p>

    <h2>Anything else I should know?</h2>
    <p>
      Well, since you asked. I'm trying to learn Swedish and practice Italian. I'm terrible and need language buddies. And if you want to hike ÃžÃ³rsmÃ¶rk with me, please, please let me know.
    </p>

    <h2>Wait. Did you say something about a free artist residency?</h2>
    <p>
      Oh, yeah. I recently moved into a large federalist home with a barn and meadow. If you want to visit for a while, I've got room for you to sleep and more room to make art and a small mountain for you to hike and ski. Stays are free, but I do ask that you contribute a small piece of art to the residency. Hit me up for the deets.
