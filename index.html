  <h2>Cool. What kind of art do you make?</h2>
  <p>
    My art is ASMR for your eyes.
  </p>
  <p>
    I grew up and live in New England and take inspiration from
    the world around me. (Who doesn't?) I really dig rocks and clouds
    and root vegetables and moving bodies. My art incorporates natural shapes
    and textures and colors and movement.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hope you feel curious and calmed when you look at my art. If do, please let me know. And if you don't, <emph>please</emph> let me know what you do feel!
  </p>

  <h2>So, what's your story?</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a guy living in a mountain valley in northern New England. These days my non-artist time is spent building software that forecasts the weather and making maps. I like spontaneous dance parties. My favorite color is orange.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was younger I studied math at Harvard, then computer science at UMass Boston, and then systems biology at Harvard again. All of these things make it into my art one way or another.
    </p>

    <h2>Anything else I should know?</h2>
    <p>
      Well, since you asked. I'm trying to learn Swedish and practice Italian. I'm terrible and need language buddies. And if you want to hike Þórsmörk with me, please, please let me know.
