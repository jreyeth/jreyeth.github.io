# Yo, I'm Josh. I'm an artist.
It's nice to meet you, too.

## Cool. What kind of art do you make?
My art is ASMR for your eyes.

I grew up and live in New England and take inspiration from
the world around me. (Who doesn't?) I really dig rocks and clouds
and root vegetables and moving bodies. My art incorporates natural shapes
and textures and colors and movement.

I hope you feel curious and calmed when you look at my art. If do, please let me know. And if you don't, please <a href="https://www.twitter.com/jreyeth" target="_blank">let me know</a> what you *do* feel!

## So, what's your story?
I'm a guy living in a mountain valley in northern New England. These days my non-artist time is spent building software that forecasts the weather and making maps. I like spontaneous dance parties. My favorite color is orange.

When I was younger I studied math at Harvard, then computer science at UMass Boston, and then systems biology at Harvard again. All of these things make it into my art one way or another.

## Anything else I should know?
Well, since you asked. I'm trying to learn Swedish and practice Italian. I'm terrible and need language buddies. And if you want to hike ÃžÃ³rsmÃ¶rk with me, please, please <a href="https://www.twitter.com/jreyeth" target="_blank">let me know</a>.

## Wait. Did you say something about a free artist residency?
Oh, yeah. I recently moved into a large Federalist home with a barn and meadow in the <a href="https://uppervalleyarts.com/what-is-the-upper-valley/" target="_blank">Upper Valley</a> of New Hampshire and Vermont. If you want to visit for a while, I've got room for you to sleep, more room to make art, and a small mountain for you to hike and ski.

Stays are free, but I do ask that you contribute a small piece of art to the residency's collection. <a href="https://www.twitter.com/jreyeth" target="_blank">Hit me up</a> for the deets.

Thank you for hanging out with me! I hope to see you again soon. ðŸ‘‹
